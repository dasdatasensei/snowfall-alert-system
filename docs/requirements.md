## Project Scope

### Overview

The Snowfall Alert System is an automated solution designed to monitor real-time snowfall conditions at ski resorts near Park City, Utah, and deliver timely alerts to a user's Android device when specific snowfall thresholds are met. The system will operate continuously through cloud-based architecture without requiring the user's device to remain powered on.

### Objectives

1. To provide skiers and snowboarders with timely notifications about fresh snowfall at nearby resorts
2. To enable data-driven decisions about which ski resort to visit based on current snow conditions
3. To implement a lightweight, reliable system that operates automatically with minimal maintenance
4. To leverage free cloud services to ensure cost-effective, continuous operation

### System Boundaries

The system will:

- Monitor approximately 10 ski resorts within a 100-mile radius of Park City, Utah
- Collect data on snowfall amounts, both current accumulation and forecast
- Process data against user-defined thresholds to determine alert conditions
- Deliver push notifications to the user's Android device
- Run on cloud infrastructure without requiring user device operation

The system will not:

- Provide general weather forecasting beyond snowfall conditions
- Support iOS devices in the initial implementation
- Offer a web-based interface in the initial implementation
- Perform historical data analysis or trend predictions
- Include resort amenities or lift status information

### Success Criteria

1. System successfully retrieves accurate snowfall data for all specified resorts
2. Notifications are delivered reliably when snowfall thresholds are met
3. The system operates continuously within free tier limits of all services
4. Alerts are timely, with data no more than 6 hours old
5. False positives are minimized through data verification between multiple sources

## Technical Requirements

### Weather Data APIs

1. **Primary Data Source: OpenWeatherMap API**

   - One Call API endpoint for snow accumulation data
   - API key securely stored as environment variable
   - Free tier usage limits: 1,000 API calls/day (sufficient for 10 resorts at 6-hour intervals)
   - Data fields required: current snow accumulation, forecast snowfall, timestamp

2. **Secondary Data Source: Weather API (formerly Weatherstack)**

   - Used for data verification to prevent false alerts
   - API key securely stored as environment variable
   - Error handling for service outages or inconsistent data
   - Data comparison logic to validate primary source information

3. **Optional Resort-Specific APIs**
   - Vail Resorts API for Park City Mountain Resort data
   - Integration when available for enhanced accuracy
   - Fallback mechanisms when resort APIs are unavailable

### Development Environment

1. **Programming Language and Libraries**

   - Python 3.9+ for serverless function development
   - Requests library for API communication
   - Firebase Admin SDK for notification management
   - JSON and datetime modules for data processing
   - Logging module for comprehensive error tracking

2. **Code Structure Requirements**
   - Object-oriented design following SOLID principles
   - Clear separation of concerns (data retrieval, processing, notification)
   - Comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging
   - Well-documented functions with descriptive docstrings
   - Modular design to allow for future enhancements

### Cloud Infrastructure

1. **AWS Lambda**

   - Memory allocation: 128MB
   - Execution timeout: 30 seconds
   - Runtime: Python 3.9
   - Handler configuration: lambda_handler function
   - IAM role with minimal required permissions

2. **AWS CloudWatch Events**

   - Scheduled rule: Every 3-6 hours
   - Target configuration: Lambda function
   - Error notification for failed executions
   - CloudWatch Logs for function output and debugging

3. **Environment Variables**
   - OPENWEATHER_API_KEY: API key for OpenWeatherMap
   - WEATHERAPI_KEY: API key for Weather API
   - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: Webhook URL for main alerts channel
   - SLACK_MONITORING_WEBHOOK_URL: Webhook URL for system monitoring notifications
   - SNOW_THRESHOLDS: JSON string of threshold configurations

### Notification System

1. **Slack Webhooks**

   - Incoming webhook integration
   - Custom message formatting with rich content
   - Channel-based notification routing
   - Error handling for failed deliveries
   - Retry mechanism for delivery failures

2. **Message Requirements**
   - Resort information in structured format
   - Snowfall amount with appropriate units
   - Alert severity indication (light/moderate/heavy)
   - Timestamp information
   - Link to resort website (when available)

### Data Processing

1. **Data Collection Logic**

   - Resort coordinates mapping (latitude, longitude)
   - API request formatting and parameter handling
   - Response parsing and validation
   - Error handling for malformed responses

2. **Alert Triggering Logic**

   - Threshold-based decision making
   - Multi-source data verification
   - De-duplication to prevent repeated alerts
   - Time-window tracking (24-hour snowfall calculations)

3. **Security Requirements**
   - HTTPS for all API communications
   - Minimal IAM permissions following principle of least privilege
   - No storage of sensitive user data
   - Secure API key management
